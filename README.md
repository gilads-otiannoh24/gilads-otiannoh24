## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 23-year-old engineering student passionate about the intersection of **AI, software, and hardware**.  
I explore how **self-improving systems** and **AI-driven hardware** can redefine automation and education — especially in developing countries.

Currently, I’m:
- Building **AI-integrated web apps** to solve real-world problems.  
- Experimenting with **Arduino** and **machine learning** for power systems.  
- Learning to blend **AI, software, and electrical systems** into scalable solutions.
